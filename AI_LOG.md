ChatGPT prompt examples:
As a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience created a React single-page application using Vite that allows an Account Manager to create, view, and edit partnerships.
From the provided JSON files (chooose-demo-partnership.json, chooose-saf-demo-partnership.json) to define the fields and default values for new partnership creation.
The new partnership includes the following fields:
Name, currency, portalUrl, features, itemFeePercent, instantBilling.
The app is fully modular, built with React 18 and Vite, using localStorage for persistence and a clean component-based structure for scalability and maintainability.

I need the entire application written in plain JavaScript (no TypeScript).

write a clear and well-structured README.md for my React app built with Vite.
The app lets an Account Manager create, view, and edit partnerships for a sustainability platform.
I want the README to sound like it was written by an experienced tech writer — easy to follow, organized, and ready for GitHub.
Please include:
How to install and set up the app using Vite (both for new and existing React projects).
A section that explains what the app does and lists its main features and behaviors.
The partnership fields (name, currency, portalUrl, features, itemFeePercent, instantBilling) and what they represent.
My short answers to these questions:
b. Key architectural and library choices: I chose React because it’s my go-to UI framework from years of experience, and Vite because it’s lightweight and makes development faster.
c. Assumptions about the data structure: I assume the data is highly detailed and flexible, allowing a very customizable user experience.
Keep it clean, use Markdown formatting (headers, bullet points, code blocks), and make it look great for a README on GitHub.



## Why I Accepted, Modified, or Rejected AI Suggestions:
- I only accept an AI suggestion after carefully reviewing the full answer in depth and confirming that it’s 100% aligned with my request and expectations.
- I modify AI responses when I realize there are elements that need to be added, adjusted, or removed — usually because the prompt lacked some context or I see an opportunity to enhance the answer with additional information or precision.
- I reject AI suggestions when the output doesn’t meet my expectations, isn’t close enough to what I envisioned, or makes it clear that my original prompt needs to be clarified or rewritten for better results.
